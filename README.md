# iRacing Standings Analyzer
A project to automate the process of calculating updated point standings for iRacing series (such as the iRacing Road To Pro Series) including nuances such as drop weeks.

This project is currently in development to analyze the 2020 NASCAR iRacing Road To Pro Oval Series standings, providing a more in-depth look into which 20 drivers will secure a spot in the NASCAR Pro Series on the ladder toward the eNASCAR iRacing Coca-Cola Series. This project is intended to automate the process of pulling the standings from the iRacing website through the pyracing "wrapper" built and maintained by Jacob Anderson (Esterni) & Xander Riga (xanderriga), then processing the standings for upload to a localized SQL database. From there, the project will pull the data from the SQL database to display statistical information and calculate items such as a driver's drop week and show how that drop week will reflect in the overall standings. For more information, questions, comments, concerns, etc., please contact Eric Wineland on iRacing or via E-Mail at eric.wineland.21@gmail.com.
